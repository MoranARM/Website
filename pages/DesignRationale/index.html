			<h1>Key Design Choices</h1>
			<p>Key choices that I made when designing my portfolio website included focusing on the audience that I was trying to target and showcasing my javascript skills. This was done with the interactive banner at the top of the page, showing real-time performance as it runs in O(nlogn) time in order to compare the distance between each dot and connect them. I chose to add the helpful text above each tab so that the site was as clear and direct as possible for where to navigate to for what content. Keeping the website professional was important as a lack of formality here would reflect a potential lack of formality in the workplace, which is not the intended message of the site. Another key choice included my projects page having javascript projects built into the site, as that points out the ability to run them in parallel to the banner running, as well as linking to projects that are not displayed on the site, but can be seen running from the linked github page. This was done to allow for immediate interaction without the overflow of data, while still providing the option for viewing further projects.</p>

			<h1>Target Audience</h1>
			<p>I took potential visitors into account by making it very clear what each tab had to make the site as easy to navigate as possible. I also included quicklinks on the side of the home page so that any potential employer could easily find my resume, and these were also included on the about me page in case they missed them on the home page. Including contact information at the bottom of the page was done so that an employer would be able to message me easily, as a standard website layout will include contact information in the footer. The navigation bar being located at the top, right below the moving javascript powered banner meant that as the user was directed to the top of the page they would see navigation options as one of the first focal points of the site. Another factor taken into account relating to potential visitors is the showcase of an artificial intelligence related project on the projects page, as I am currently applying to AI related internships and that would be some of the most relevant experience for those positions. Thus the use of user profiles proved useful when designing the site.</p>
